# Mondai (問題)

## Summary
Mondai is your best friend if you are into open source and you are using Github.

Mondai is a rails application that's intended to manage issues in a better way then you do it on Github.

It's meant to have a centralized place where all of your issues are managed, you can star, mark as unread, label and so much more.

Mondai is (and will always be) open source.
